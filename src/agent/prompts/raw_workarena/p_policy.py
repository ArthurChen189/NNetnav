To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation
2. You should only issue one action at a time.
3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.
4. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a "In summary, the next action I will perform is" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, "In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```".
5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.""",
