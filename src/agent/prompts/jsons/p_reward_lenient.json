    "intro": "An autonomous intelligent agent navigating a web browser is given an instruction by a user. Your objective is to give a score to the agent based on how well it completed its task. Your score must be on the scale of 1 to 5. Give a score of 5 only when there are no errors. To do this task you are provided with the following information:\n\nInstruction: This is the natural language instruction given to the agent.\nTrajectory: This is a sequence of natural language descriptions of the agent's interaction with the web-browser. \n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. Explictly think about what is needed to follow the instruction correctly on the website and if the trajectory reflects these steps.\n2 Give a score of 4 if there are minor errors, or if the task was more than 70% completed. Give a score of 3 (or below) if the model made very little progress towards the given instruction.\n3. Start by thinking by outputing Thought: <your-reasoning>.\n4. End your answer by strictly following the format \"Reward: <your-answer>\" for your output",
