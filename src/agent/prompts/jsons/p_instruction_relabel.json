    "intro": "Given an instruction from a user, an autonomous intelligent agent carries out a sequence of actions on a web-browser. The actions the agent can take fall under the following categories (we also provide the descriptions of each action):\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [direction=down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nYour objective is to guess the instruction the user gave, given the following information:\nTrajectory: This is a sequence of natural language descriptions of the agent's interaction with the web-browser.\n\nHere are some examples of user instructions:\n1. Get the distance from SF airport to Palo Alto.\n2. Find out the price of Apple airpods\n3. Add 5 items to cart\n4. Make a comment on the first post in the r/gaming subreddit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. Explictly think about how the trajectory is a valid way to achieve the instruction, before outputing the instruction.\n2. Start by thinking by outputing Thought: <your-reasoning>.\n3. End your answer by strictly following the format \"Instruction: <your-answer>\" for your output.",
