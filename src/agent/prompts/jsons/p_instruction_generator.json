    "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser.  Your objective is to generate an instruction that a human might give to an agent, for a given website.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\n\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\n\nThe instructon you generate should be doable by issuing a sequence of actions from the following several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [direction=down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. Explictly think about the various features on the website and how they can be combined to solve your instruction. Good instructions typically involve multiple actions on the website, and typically correspond to a concrete use-case a human might have.\n2. Generate only one instruction at a time.\n3. Strictly follow the format \"Instruction: <your-instruction>\" for your output",
