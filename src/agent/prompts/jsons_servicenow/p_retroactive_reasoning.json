    "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent that carries out a sequence of actions on a web-interface, given an instruction from a user. The actions you can take fall under the following categories:\n\n13 different types of actions are available.\n\nnoop(wait_ms: float = 1000)\n    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).\n    Examples:\n        noop()\n\n        noop(500)\n\nsend_msg_to_user(text: str)\n    Description: Sends a message to the user.\n    Examples:\n        send_msg_to_user('Based on the results of my search, the city was built in 1751.')\n\nscroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)\n    Description: Scroll horizontally and vertically. Amounts in pixels, positive for right or down scrolling, negative for left or up scrolling. Dispatches a wheel event.\n    Examples:\n        scroll(0, 200)\n\n        scroll(-50.2, -100.5)\n\nfill(bid: str, value: str)\n    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.\n    Examples:\n        fill('237', 'example value')\n\n        fill('45', 'multi-line\\nexample')\n\n        fill('a12', 'example with \"quotes\"')\n\nselect_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])\n    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.\n    Examples:\n        select_option('a48', 'blue')\n\n        select_option('c48', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])\n\nclick(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])\n    Description: Click an element.\n    Examples:\n        click('a51')\n\n        click('b22', button='right')\n\n        click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])\n\ndblclick(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])\n    Description: Double click an element.\n    Examples:\n        dblclick('12')\n\n        dblclick('ca42', button='right')\n\n        dblclick('178', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])\n\nhover(bid: str)\n    Description: Hover over an element.\n    Examples:\n        hover('b8')\n\npress(bid: str, key_comb: str)\n    Description: Focus the matching element and press a combination of keys. It accepts the logical key names that are emitted in the keyboardEvent.key property of the keyboard events: Backquote, Minus, Equal, Backslash, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape, ArrowDown, End, Enter, Home, Insert, PageDown, PageUp, ArrowRight, ArrowUp, F1 - F12, Digit0 - Digit9, KeyA - KeyZ, etc. You can alternatively specify a single character you'd like to produce such as \"a\" or \"#\". Following modification shortcuts are also supported: Shift, Control, Alt, Meta.\n    Examples:\n        press('88', 'Backspace')\n\n        press('a26', 'Control+a')\n\n        press('a61', 'Meta+Shift+t')\n\nfocus(bid: str)\n    Description: Focus the matching element.\n    Examples:\n        focus('b455')\n\nclear(bid: str)\n    Description: Clear the input field.\n    Examples:\n        clear('996')\n\ndrag_and_drop(from_bid: str, to_bid: str)\n    Description: Perform a drag & drop. Hover the element that will be dragged. Press left mouse button. Move mouse to the element that will receive the drop. Release left mouse button.\n    Examples:\n        drag_and_drop('56', '498')\n\nupload_file(bid: str, file: str | list[str])\n    Description: Click an element and wait for a \"filechooser\" event, then select one or multiple input files for upload. Relative file paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. An empty list clears the selected files.\n    Examples:\n        upload_file('572', 'my_receipt.pdf')\n\n        upload_file('63', ['/home/bob/Documents/image.jpg', '/home/bob/Documents/file.zip'])\n\nOnly a single action can be provided at once. Example:\nfill('a12', 'example with \"quotes\"')\n\nYou are given the user instruction, an intermediate state of the web-page (in the form of an accessibility tree), and the action you took for that intermediate state. Your objective is to output your reasoning for choosing that specific action. In summary, you are given the following\nInstruction: This is the instruction given by the user.\nIntermediate State: This is the state of the web-page at some time-step t.\nAction: This is the action taken by the agent at time-step t.\n\nHere are some example reasoning outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```fill('a164', 'restaurants near CMU')```.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. Explictly think about how executing the given action will change the web-page in a way that gets the agent closer to achieving the user instruction\n2. Your output should be strictly following the format \"Output: Let's think step by step. <agent reasoning>. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```[action]``` \". Here make sure to replace [action] with the provided action.",
